"""Standardized API-key handling for agent-loop-skills.

Keys live in one file at the PROJECT ROOT — ``<repo root>/keys.env`` (the nearest .git
ancestor of the working directory, else the CWD) — shared by every skill in that
project. It MUST be gitignored (it sits inside the repo). Real OS env vars take
precedence over the file.

This module is a drop-in standard: the ENGINE below is identical across skills; each
skill edits only the KEYS registry. status() reports presence as booleans only — never
the values — so onboarding never puts a secret in the conversation.

The full convention is documented in this skill's SKILL.md ("API keys").
